GY-61 DXL335 3-Axis Accelerometer Module Info
GY-61 DXL335 3-Axis Accelerometer Module is a three axis accelerometer sensor module based on ADXL335 integrated circuit. The ADXL335 is a triple axis accelerometer with extremely low noise and power consumption. The sensor has a full sensing range of +/-3g. It can measure the static acceleration of gravity in tilt-sensing applications, as well as dynamic acceleration resulting from motion, shock, or vibration.

There is an on-board 3.3V voltage regulator to power the ADXL335 so power provided should be between 3.3V and 6V DC.
